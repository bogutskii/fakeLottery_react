          This simulator is designed for entertainment purposes only and does not involve real money transactions or payments. It is a virtual representation of a lottery, demonstrating the generation of random values and their matching. Please be aware that this is not a real lottery, and there are no actual prizes or financial claims associated with it.
The simulator operates on a pseudo-random number generation method implemented in JavaScript. It is provided as-is, and while we strive to maintain its functionality, there is no guarantee of immediate resolution for any issues that may arise.
By using this simulator, you acknowledge that it is purely for recreational purposes, and any outcomes or results are random and do not carry any real-world value. We do not accept any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of the simulated lottery results.
If you encounter any issues or have feedback, you are welcome to report them, and we will consider improvements, although there is no guarantee of prompt resolution.
Thank you for understanding the nature of this simulation.
